                    <h2>Food For Family</h2>
                    <p>In light of the high pre-existing rates of malnutrition across the country (54% stunted, 56% underweight, 17% wasted), the nutrition situation can easily and quickly deteriorate after a disaster (FAO 2010). Factors such as insufficient hygiene and inadequate shelter and safe spaces for women to breastfeed may negatively impact nutrition.</p>

                    <p>People living under the open sky are especially vulnerable to the spread of diseases. Road-side shelters, or Beribandh, are often particularly unhygienic. The number of people suffering acute watery diarrhea, skin-eye-ear infections, and other waterborne diseases, is likely to increase.</p>

                    <p>School buildings are regularly used as collective centers to accommodate people. Schools often provide shelter to people that are displaced as a result of flooding; such a situation is often prolonged as people are unable to repair shelters immediately. As a result, these schools are vulnerable to damage to their infrastructure, learning environment and WASH facilities.</p>
